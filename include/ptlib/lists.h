/**This class is a collection of objects which are descendents of the
   <code>PObject</code> class. It is implemeted as a doubly linked list.

   The implementation of a list allows very fast inserting and deleting of
   objects in the collection, but has severe penalties for random access. All
   object access should be done sequentially to avoid these speed penalties.

   The class remembers the last accessed element. This state information is
   used to optimise access by the "virtual array" model of collections. If
   access via ordinal index is made sequentially there is little overhead.

   The PAbstractList class would very rarely be descended from directly by
   the user. The <code>PDECLARE_LIST</code> and <code>PLIST</code> macros would normally
   be used to create descendent classes. They will instantiate the template
   based on <code>PList</code> or directly declare and define the class (using
   inline functions) if templates are not being used.

   The <code>PList</code> class or <code>PDECLARE_LIST</code> macro will define the
   correctly typed operators for subscript access (operator[]).

/**This class is a collection of objects which are descendents of the
   <code>PObject</code> class. It is implemeted as a Red-Black binary tree to
   maintain the objects in rank order. Note that this requires that the
   <code>PObject::Compare()</code> function be fully implemented oin objects
   contained in the collection.

   The implementation of a sorted list allows fast inserting and deleting as
   well as random access of objects in the collection. As the objects are being
   kept sorted, "fast" is a relative term. All operations take o(lg n) unless
   a particular object is repeatedly accessed.

   The class remembers the last accessed element. This state information is
   used to optimise access by the "virtual array" model of collections. If
   repeated access via ordinal index is made there is little overhead. All
   other access incurs a minimum overhead, but not insignificant.

   The PAbstractSortedList class would very rarely be descended from directly
   by the user. The <code>PDECLARE_LIST</code> and <code>PLIST</code> macros would normally
   be used to create descendent classes. They will instantiate the template
   based on <code>PSortedList</code> or directly declare and define the class (using
   inline functions) if templates are not being used.

   The <code>PSortedList</code> class or <code>PDECLARE_SORTED_LIST</code> macro will
   define the correctly typed operators for subscript access
   (operator[]).
